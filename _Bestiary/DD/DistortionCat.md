# Distortion Cat
---
An upper C-Ranked monster that can bend light and create artificial darkness. In its home territory, it is attacked and bound by tentacle like parasites that form a symbiotic relationship with it.

## Physical Description
a large cat-like form. Paws nearly 20 inches wide The powerful body was half again as large as a tiger, and pitch black. A tail twitched back and forth in anticipation, the creature obviously excited by this new hunting ground. Along its back four tentacles extended from each of its leg joints, each of them had its own mouth and was tipped with a sharp claw-like stinger which dripped venom.
 Its head was very similar to a mountain lion, but had no mouth. Instead, it had an extra eye in the center of its forehead, the only bright spot on its body. seems the tentacles are a different creature. They are a parasite that forms a symbiotic relationship with the Distortion Cat. Becoming bonded with the tentacle parasites causes it agony every second until they are fully dependent on each other, making the Catâ€™s mind descend into hatred for others. When it feels threatened it thickens the darkness in the area to hide. If it is too bright, it distorts the light - bending it around itself, effectively becoming invisible while an illusion forms a few feet away. Then it attacks with its tentacles, the illusion and real thing hit the same spot to lend credence to the illusion being the real Beast.
