# Nyanderthal

An Affiliation of cats, not necessarily a species that all subscribe to a mantra of neutrality. They align with none and conflict with none. Accumulating wealth in the shadows for 'fun'. They gain possession of information they probably shouldn't have, and tend to place that information into the pockets of those who cause the biggest catastrophes with them.

They have many complex and 'Irritating' rules that they all know but don't share with others making them guess the rules, and many outsiders are convinced the rules are made up.
