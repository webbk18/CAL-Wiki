# Essence
---
Short for 'Quintessence', but as that is a mouthful it is usually shortened.

Essence is the fundamental energy of the universe, the pure power of the heavens and earth that is used by the basic elements to become everything.

Rocks turn it into earth essence
Water into water, both are impure forms

A [Dungeon Core](DungeonCore.md) can use [Essence](Essence.md) to alter the world under their influence.
