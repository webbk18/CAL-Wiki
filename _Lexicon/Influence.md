# Influence
---
The way a [Dungeon Core](DungeonCore.md) grows their dungeon by releasing [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md). 

When something or somebody is under the influence of a dungeon, it can be fully understood, used and controlled. ie; weapons, armor, magic, animals, dead people 

As the range of influence increases, essence will slowly and passively flow back to the dungeon. As the dungeon's ramge increases the passive essence flow will also increase.
