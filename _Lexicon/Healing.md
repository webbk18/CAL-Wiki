# Healing
---
All [Affinity](Affinity.md)s can Heal, but the person being healed can feel the essence being used.

- Fire feels like your body is being cauterized
- Earth grinds really bad
- Water feels cool and soothing
- Plant or Wood feels like roots or worms squirming though you
- Celestial healers are called 'Clerics' and are most sought after
- Infernal is going to hurt more than the original wound did
