# Dungeon Boss
---
A [Mob](_Lexicon/DungeonMonster.md) that when created used a large portion of the [Dungeon's](_Lexicon/DungeonCore.md) power so that it is stronger than the other mobs at the dungeon's disposal. Later the Boss may become a normal monster as stonger bosses are created. Dungeon Bosses are used to protect the [Dungeon Core](_Lexicon/DungeonCore.md) in most cases.

A mob cannot be made at the dungeon's level or higher. ie; Dungeon of F0 can create at best a G9 mob.
