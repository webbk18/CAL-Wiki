# Beast Core
---
A gem that grows inside a magical [Beast](Beast.md) from birth. Every type of creature absorbs [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md), but only the type they are suited until they are very strong, which takes 100+ years.

If a Beast Core is Swallowed willingly all of the essence in the core of the swallower will flow into the Beast  Core and take the [Corruption](Corruption.md) with it. It will continue to pull essence from the body until there is nothing left but the personal life force, which the Core will also try to take.
