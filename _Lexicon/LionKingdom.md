## Capitol
- Capitol is adjacent to the ocean
- Buildings are made from whitewashed stone
- "Hot Beautiful and Filthy" - Hans
- At one point the fecal matter in the city got high enough that the King's daughter's Horse slipped and she got messy. King Hired water mages to flush the streets clean of both the poop and the homeless.
	- Earth mages are now building an elaborate sewage system under the city.
- Madam Chandra's Pleasure House; Painted in garish colors with suggestive yet refined paintings on the walls.
