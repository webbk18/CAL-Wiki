# Runes
---
A permanent pattern made of Essence that creates an effect on the universe. Try not to get the pattern wrong, as it could have... unintended consequences. This is another name for a completed Inscription.


Permanent Enchantments made by cutting [Inscription](Inscription.md) perfectly into an object and adding Essence to it.

If there is a flaw, the [Essence](Essence.md) will flow out and the pattern would be useless at best, and at worst would activate with an unintended effect.

When Done properly however, the enchantment becomes difficult to remove as the Essence used strengthens the pattern.

Many Runes that interlock together are called [[Runescript]].

Poorly made runes tend to explode.


## Cal's Experiments
- DD1 Chp22
	- Air rune that screams
	- Multi essence rune that opened a rift to the Abyss
	- Rune from Craig's clothing that refines essence
	- series of Essence refining runes, one of which opens a minor portal and looses a [Distortion Cat](../_Bestiary/DD/DistortionCat.md)
		- After fixing that rune the [Runescript](Runescript) condenses essence to a liquid allowing for cal to gain 0.5% of his capacity an hour or one F-ranked person.
