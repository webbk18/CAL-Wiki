# Runes
---
Permanent Enchantments made by cutting [Inscriptions](Inscriptions.md) perfectly into an object and adding Essence to it.

If there is a flaw, the [Essence](Essence.md) will flow out and the pattern would be useless at best, and at worst would activate with an unintended effect.

When Done properly however, the enchantment becomes difficult to remove as the Essence used strengthens the pattern.

Many Runes that interlock together are called [[Runescript]].
