# Dungeon Born
---
A creature not directly created by a dungeon but given life though the dungeon. This gives the creature the ability to act for itself with the downside of the dungeon not being able to take direct control of it's mind. A dungeon can ride along in a dungeon born, and if the creature is a lower rank than the dungeon, the dungeon can influence the creature.
