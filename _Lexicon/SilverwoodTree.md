# Silverwood
---
A mysterious tree that has silver wood and leaves. Some say that it helps cultivators move into the B-rankings.

Silverwood Trees have some of the most potent magic of any plant. They purify the [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md) of those around it. Only an S-ranked Spiritual energy can duplicate the effects they offer.

Worshiped by the [Elves](Elves.md) as the pollen from this tree is what allows the elves to become fertile and bear childrens.
