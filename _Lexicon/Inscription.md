# Inscriptions
---
A permanent pattern made of Essence that creates an effect on the universe. Try not to get the pattern wrong, as it could have...  unintended consequences. This is another name for incomplete or  
unknown [Runes](Runes.md).


Cuttings in an object with [Essence](Essence.md) put into them. Done perfectly they become [Runes](Runes.md)
