gather their own food and make short-term plans. The mid-F ranks are

known as the fishy or “failure” rank.

dangerous. A D-ranked individual can usually fight off ten F-ranked
beings without issue. They are characterized by a “fractal” in their Chi
spiral.

have opened all of their meridians. A C-ranked cultivator can usually fight
