# Essence
---
Short for 'Quintessence', but as that is a mouthful it is usually shortened.

Essence is the fundamental energy of the universe, the pure power of the heavens and earth that is used by the basic elements to become everything. There are six major types are names: Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Celestial, Infernal.

Rocks turn it into earth essence
Water into water, both are impure forms

A [Dungeon Core](DungeonCore.md) can use [Essence](Essence.md) to alter the world under their influence. 

Sentient Creatures such as [Humans](Humans.md)], [Elves](Elves.md), [Dwarves](Dwarves.md) and [Orcs](Orcs.md) absorb Essence in a process called [Cultivation](Cultivation.md).

Cycling Essence through one's eyes allows them to Essence and how it is flowing.
