# Dungeon Core
---
A Dungeon Core is a beast core that has gained the first level of sentience, and has realized the consequences of life and death.

Dungeon Cores grow by releasing [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md) in a way unique to them called [Influence](_Lexicon/Influence.md). 

Dungeons Grow by filling the areas around them with their essence wich allows them to control it. They can reposition their core and this is easier to do while in an area under their influence. Dungeons usually grow slowly to lessen the noise and vibration compressing and moving stone creates.

Dungeons protect their cores by moving them to difficult to get to places and with [Dungeon Monsters](DungeonMonster.md). This is because Dungeon Cores are a component in some high level spells.
