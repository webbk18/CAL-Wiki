> "Don’t make nodes in the Tower unless it follows the pattern! Six per
floor. It was six per floor!”
The old man sassed, “Odd, I was told seven was the correct
number to aim for.”

“As soon as the Prime Six were down, they went on a
Heaven-cursed race to fill the slots! No thought was given early on to
adding Nodes in a reasonable method so that climbing resulted in a
pattern that could be expected. First floor: water. Second floor: water

and air, for mist. Then do all the combinations of two’s, and once
you’re done with them all, proceed adding the combination of threes
in higher levels.

“Reasonable, yes? Did they do that?” Cataphron punched a
corpse so hard that the channeled might of the blow created a
twenty-foot deep hole in a perfect cylinder. His voice was breaking,
and the personality of Cataphron faltered as a mélange and mixture
of several other voices all spoke and aired their grievances at the
same time. It was like with the Wood Elves, but without the soothing
quality, and a reverb that was more... doom-y. “No!

“Second floor! What do those idiots slot? Infernal and earth,
water and earth; air and water; water and celestial; fire and celestial;
then water, earth and celestial. What? That’s a tri-combination! Then
I turn the page for the next tier, and the first thing I read is an
infernal, fire, and earth. What is another triple combination doing on
the second and third tiers? Who thought that was a good idea?”
