# Necromancer
---
An [Infernal](../_Characters/DivineDungeon/Infernal.md) Essence cultivator who can raise and control the dead and [Demons](../_Bestiary/Demon.md).


They hoard and protect all knowledge pertaining to them.

To capture a human soul the necromancer has to have a specially prepared stone and be S-ranked at least.

Necromantic cultivation isn't Illegal, but it has a really bad reputation. The main way they get more powerful is by absorbing the burst of Necromantic energy that results from something dying. More energy can be obtained if there is strong emotion flowing through the person at the time of death, so many turn to torture, murder and more unsavory things.

Demon Summoning is illegal everywhere. [Demons](../_Bestiary/Demon.md) are cunning and intelligent  and do everything they can to please their master so they don't get thrown back into the abyss.

Raising the dead isn't illegal but frowned upon. The reanimated creature has to do what the summoner wants and is always insane. The souls that are able to be summoned are those that have run from the Creator's judgement. They fear the void and the abyss. They wander the earth and can never stop moving and can never sleep, taste or feel. By the time they get summoned all they want its to kill the living and absorb their energy.
