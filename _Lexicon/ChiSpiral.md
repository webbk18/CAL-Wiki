# Chi Spiral
---
Pronouced 'Key Spiral' as Dani will Haughtily tell you.

The Chi Spiral helps process [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md). By forming a thread of [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md) and spinning it around your center. The more complex and complete the pattern woven into it, the more Essence it can hold and the finer the Essence can be refined.


To break into the D ranks, the spiral has to be shattered into a Fractal, or in other words a spiral of spirals.
To achieve this you find the smallest part of the chi spiral, which doesn't affect the rest and start there. It should pull essence from the rest of the spiral as a thread the same comparative size as the thread coming from the Essence into the Chi spiral. You take that smallest part and spin it opposite of the rest of the spiral. This should put all the Chi into a single thread, and make that thread thinner and more refined. From there the same opposite spin has to be done in two sperate areas simultaneously. Holding this pattern takes immense concentration and a lot of Essence
