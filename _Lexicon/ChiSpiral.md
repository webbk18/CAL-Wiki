Pronouced 'Key Spiral' as Dani will Haughtily tell you.

The Chi Spiral helps process [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md). By forming a thread of [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md) and spinning it around your center. The more complex and complete the pattern woven into it, the more Essence it can hold and the finer the Essence can be refined.
