# Formation
---
A Formation, most commonly known as Spell Formations, or Spell-forms. Are methods of connecting multiple Spells together. This functions much the same as script, but is not limited to a sentence formation. A Formation can be a three-dimensional masterpiece of artistic connections that do not have to be placed in sequence, for a sequence of activations to occur. Unlike [Script](Script.md), which looks to form sentences, Formations create large images.
