# Elves
---
A race of willowy humanoids with pointy ears. There are five main types:

- High Elves: The largest nation of Elvenkind, they spend most of their
time as merchants, artists, or thinkers. Rich beyond any need to actually
work, their King is an S-ranked expert, and their cities shine with light
and wealth. They like to think of themselves as ‘above’ other Elves, thus
‘High’ Elves.  [[Luminaria]]

- Wood Elves: Wood Elves live more simply than High Elves, but have
greater connection to the earth and the elements. They are ruled by a
counsel of S-ranked elders and rarely leave their woods. Though seen
less often, they have great power. They grow and collect food and animal
products for themselves and other Elven nations.

- Wild: Wild Elves are the outcasts of their societies, basically feral, they
scorn society, civilization, and the rules of others. They have the worst
reputation of any of the races of Elves, practicing dark arts and infernal
summoning. They have no homeland, living only where they can get
away with their dark deeds.

- Dark: The Drow are known as Dark Elves. No one knows where they
live, only where they can go to get in contact with them. Dark Elves also
have a dark reputation as Assassins and mercenaries for the other
races. The worst of their lot are ‘Moon Elves’, the best-known Assassins
of any race. These are the Elves that Dale made a deal with for land and
protection. [Huine](../_Atlas/DivineDungeon/Huine.md)

- Sea: The Sea Elves live on boats their entire lives. They facilitate trade
between all the races of Elves and man, trying not to take sides in
conflicts. They work for themselves and are considered rather
mysterious.
