# Spotter
---
A ‘Spotter’ is a Mage-ranked person who specialized in determining the hidden properties of an unknown item. 

They can read Inscriptions, energy flows, and have a deep understanding of history and the lore of most abilities that had been seen before. They are often assigned to scout teams that helped determine when people, places, or items had gone down a dark path. 

Less well liked, the church has their own version called inquisitors.
