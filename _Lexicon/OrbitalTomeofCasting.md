# Orbital Tome of Casting
---
Orbital Tome of Casting was the Bibliomancer’s primary method
for spell-slinging. Sam could bind and summon up to six books at
any given time, each with its own spell assignment, which would
revolve around him, just waiting to be activated. Basically, he had six
floating, book-shaped machine guns. Some fired fast and held a ton
of rounds, like his [PaperShuriken](PaperShuriken.md) tomes, while others were more
powerful but lower capacity, like his Rorschach Spell or [Papier-Mache Mage](Papier-MacheMage.md)
