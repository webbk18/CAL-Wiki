# Script
---
A Script, or scripting, is a method of connecting multiple Runes together. Rune-script being its most common form. Script is called such because from a distance, the Runes look like words in sentences, with individual Runes acting as letters. The method in which the script is arranged alters which Runes are activated when. Script allows Rune activations to loop back into the beginning of the script. Allowing the effect to run so long as it is powered.
