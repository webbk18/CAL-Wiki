Five percent of all profit will go to the Land owner, [Dale](_Characters/DivineDungeon/Dale.md). However, for the first five years, Dale will earn Three percent. The other Two percent will go to [Frank](_Characters/DivineDungeon/Frank.md) and he will outfit Dale with a team, basic equipment, food, lodging and teachers.
