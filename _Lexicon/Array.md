# Array
---
An Array is an older method of connecting multiple Inscriptions without directly overlapping them. You need a certain amount of Runes or Inscriptions that work together to trigger an effect, and they have to be placed a set distance away from one another, in addition to being linked by ‘sympathetic connections’. Example: Armor doesn’t function properly if you’re not wearing all the pieces, even if it does resize to keep the sigils aligned while it tries to refit.
