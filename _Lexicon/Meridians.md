# Meridians
---
Meridians are energy channels that transport life energy (Chi/[Essence](Essence.md)) throughout the body.

There are 12 paired meridians, six 'yin' and six 'yang'. There are also two single sets, the 'governing' and 'conception' sets. Those allow people to form Chi in the first place, and where forced open when young, usually at birth.

The more meridians that are cleansed and opened, the stronger the body becomes.
