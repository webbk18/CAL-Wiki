---
A Monster Created by a dungeon. Also known as a 'Mob' for short. A dungeon monster cannot survive for long outside of the dungeon without dying from lack of essence. A mob cannot be made at the dungeon's level or higher. ie; Dungeon of F0 can create at best a G9 mob.

### Creation
1) Created from the Dungeon's [Essence](_Lexicon/Essence.md)
	 - The larger the creature, the longer it will take to mature OR the more essence it will take.
2) Natural Plant or Animal that that has gained cultivation ranks by absorbing essence.
	- This Creature will not obey the dungeon completely unless it swears loyalty.

### Evolution
Creatures can evolve when supplied with the energy to do so, or they can absorb items or diffrent elements to change themselves naturally.

Different types of essence will result in different evolutions.
