- Steps on the Path to Virtue
	- Chapter 12
		- Verse 4 - “The hallmark of an open mind is not letting your ideas become your identity. If you define yourself by your opinions, questioning them is a threat to your integrity. If, instead, you see yourself as a curious person or a learner, changing your mind is a moment of growth. This is a step on the path to virtue.”
