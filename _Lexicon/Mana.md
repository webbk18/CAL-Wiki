# Mana
Mana – A higher stage of Essence only able to be cultivated by those who have
broken into at least the B-rankings and found the true name of something in the
universe.---

“I warn you, Artorian. Breaching
the fifth tier requires another cultivator to provide you with Essence
to climb while you climb, or you will not make it. Above the tenth
requires an additional two, and every five levels thereafter another
two C-rankers more. Essence deprivation is the most common cause
of climb-failure. Knowing you as I do, I expect you to try something...
ridiculous. The amount of Essence a cultivator can carry in human
‘C-ranks’ is insufficient to push past the fourth tier. This is all given

my calculations from the last time I was in a position to check. That
was a long time ago, so do math accordingly.”
