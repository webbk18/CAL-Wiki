# ManaContract
---
Contract signed with [Mana](Mana.md)-infused ink that is impossible to fake or forge. This contract will also be enforced magically.

The landowner is magically enforced. Any citizen under the political rank of a Duke would be forced to leave if the landowner told them to. They cannot force someone to stay , or to do things for them, but the landowner can obviously make them leave.
