- *Chapter 14 of [DungeonBorn](_Books/DivineDungeon/DungeonBorn.md)*

Payment for the land the church is on
- Healing as needed for a small offering
- Teach and train youngsters for no charge
	- Accept any into his order with an affinity to Celestial essence
- Provide a bank with small fees to provide income to the church and pay rent to Dale.

[Father Richard](../_Characters/DivineDungeon/FatherRichard.md) used three lots and not the one lot agreed upon.
