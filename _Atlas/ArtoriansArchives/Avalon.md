# Avalon
---
A city that greets newcomers with open arms and [Lunella](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Lunella.md) helps each person find a home and a purpose.

## City Layout:
Organized in Square Subdivisions that form a circle separated into three sections
1) Center contains [Lunella](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Lunella.md)'s original village
2) inner ring is dedicated to non-cultivators 
3) Separate and distinct 'pie slices' divide up the outer ring.
