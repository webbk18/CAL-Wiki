# Avalon
---
A city that greets newcomers with open arms and [Lunella](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Lunella.md) helps each person find a home and a purpose.

## City Layout:
Organized in Square Subdivisions that form a circle separated into three sections
1) Center contains [Lunella](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Lunella.md)'s original village
2) inner ring is dedicated to non-cultivators 
3) Separate and distinct 'pie slices' divide up the outer ring.

		- Caldera is an impact crater from the first heavenly that managed to fully physically manifest inside Cal's Soul space. She did so in the sky forgetting gravity was a thing, screeched like a distressed coyote the whole way down and pancaked the ground then offered a meek 'ow'
	- inner sides of the caldera are riddled with narrow walkways
	- lake in the middle of the caldera covered in green lily pads, massive ones
	- Sisters of the Paw , Godhand Clan Glitterflits
