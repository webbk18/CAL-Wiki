# Realms

## [Alfheim](Alfheim.md)
The realm for the majority of Elves in Cal’s Soul Space. This skyland supports anything in the C-ranks. Is built around having pill cultivation. Alfheim has no supervisor.

## [Asgard](Asgard.md)
The realm of elementals, heroes, and small party accidents. This skyland supports anything A-ranked; from minimum to apex. (As well as Odin’s ego, if just barely.) This realm was having a swarm problem, but after some… suggestions, those were taken care of. Odin is the supervisor of this realm.
