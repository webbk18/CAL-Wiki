South of the Phantom Mountains is a swamp that is the border between the Lion and Phoenix Kingdoms.
Deep in this swamp accessible by only the brave or knowledgeable is an ancient fortress, a mold covered ruin. There are grotesque statues and carved works on the walls. Shrunken skulls line the battlements with burning eyes that seem to follow you. The gates and drawbridge are manned by undead.
