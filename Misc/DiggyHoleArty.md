" *Brothers of eternium, swing swing swing with me,
Raise your hands and praise the sun, sing sing sing with me.
Up and up into the sun, who knows how we'll have some fun, Pillows, babs and skimmers to ride, when we get to archive*

*Born under sun, get up at the ripe of dawn
Raised having fun, at the evening it was time to yawn
Skin made of love, leaf pose is on
To nap and nap makes me free
Come on babs, sing with me..~*

I am Artorian and I'm rigging a sun
Riggy riggy sun, rigging a sun* "

Deep deep in the land
Even saw a blue moon blow
Arty flies so low
Fill a glass and down coffee!
Stuff your bellies, I have treats!
Stumble home and fall asleep
Dreaming in our pillow keep* "
