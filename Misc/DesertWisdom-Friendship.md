Desert Wisdom: A lion’s 13 levels of friendship.
 Note that most friends are level five or below.
 One. A fellow of the same age, or other circumstantial connection.
 Two. An acquaintance that you can nod with on a given topic.
 Three. A colleague, or person you can sit and have a long conversation with.
 Four. A person with whom you sit around, able to have a good conversation.
 Five. A companion in conversations that occur at odd, or otherwise unreasonable times, yet you do not mind the intrusion. One to offer a drink even in the middle of night.
 Six. A companion, with clear concern for your wellbeing.
 Seven. A close companion or comrade, particularly in travel, whom you are certain that you can depend upon to hold your money.
 Eight. The proper attribution of the word ‘friend,’ a person who comes to you without ulterior motive.
 Nine. A close friend, worthy of intimate secrets, whose very presence makes you happy.
 Ten. A friend whose presence can bring you calm, peace, and happiness. An inducted member of the family that one’s mother considers part of the table.
 Eleven. A person whose comfort and familiarity is second nature, whom you trust with not only your life, but your money and wife.
 Twelve. A chosen best friend. Held in regard above all others. One whom you tell your most closely guarded secrets and sins, for their burden is safe to share.
 Thirteen. As is the Kin of Ana to the Obi of Ken, this person is your spiritual double; inseparable from you, and so entwined with your sense of self that their loss would shatter you whole. Striking your name from all ledgers, as even if you lived, who you were would forever be dead.
