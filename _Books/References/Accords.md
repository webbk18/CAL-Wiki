I don't know what's up with that one, but it seems like it would upset a whole lot of people. Not doing it. A log of my deeds. My great works. My successes... and my failures. My mistakes. My regrets. My _cronicles._ Completionist Chronicles! Also at least 21 books. I can't let longbeard one-up me. I'm sure I can do something to fill the empty void between the covers.
