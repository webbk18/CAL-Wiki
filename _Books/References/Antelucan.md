| 7       | He motioned to the Pylon, which had once been some kind of apocalyptic squirrel obsessed with counting only in nuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |     |     |
| 7       | “By which I mean, this is Kronk! The racer is lever operated! You do it with feeling. Yell out: ‘Pull the lever, Kronk!’” The dwarf reached out to grasp at air and make an example motion. “Then, ya yank one!” Don’s enthusiasm doubled. “If all goes well, great! If suddenly a hole appears in the ground and you fall, or anything else goes wrong that shouldn’t have, ya yell: ‘Wrong leverrrr!’” Dimi nodded, experienced in the matter. “You may then complain and question why we even have that lever. Just remember to remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times. She’s a roller coaster!” The half-giant motioned from the racer up to the crystal. “You have to feel the power, or rather, Kronk must feel it.” Don picked the thread up. “Kronk speaks at times, so don’t be surprised. It’s a very deep and sultry voice for a squirrel. Think of a large human man with very good manners that is more in it to make you happy than to have a good time. Not the brightest Nixie tube in the box, but means well. Will also, at complete random, have the brightest of ideas, but will never be able to explain to you how you arrived at a location before someone else when it was clearly unreasonable and shouldn’t have happened.” |     |     |
