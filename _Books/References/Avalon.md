(244) 33 "Artorian’s mind encountered a slowly spinning rainbow error."



Artorian broke into a song that mostly matched the magic carpet ride he was being taken along on. *Clap clap*. Scholar D, a legend is he, mighty A-kota! Writes like ten regular men, verbose is he. *Clap clap*. He’s gone and done it again. *Clap clap*. He’s written a whole other tale. *Clap clap*. Something, Anything, Everything, so hale! The old man awkwardly stopped as he lost the thread after his last line, whistling the tune of the first line again while finger twirling. Henry even commented instead of attacking. “It was good, up until the last line, where the cadence fell off a cliff.”


onto Hitchhiking like a climbing hold on an angled wall. That had been a strong yeet! He blinked before looking around, not having a floor to stand on before commenting. “Oh, you’re funny ! Here just in case someone hangs around, hmmm ?”
 “Don’t thank me or anything.” The dour node hung its metaphorical head while commenting, pulling Artorian up onto solid flooring, and speaking in an accent that Artorian had no idea what to do with. Like a depressed, homeless, automaton. “All the others tend to have a cheerful and sunny disposition. Like doors. Don’t expect that from me.”
 “Well thank you anyway, but I think I need to be a bit lower than this for now?” Artorian deduced, seeing how high up he was. “Could you release me?”
 “You should really go up. I could calculate your chances of survival if you go down.” The shrugging node morosely told him. “But you wouldn’t like it.”
 Artorian instantly pulled the Tibbins expression. This was the moment for it. “Please let me go.”
 “Sure. Thanks a lot for leaving me behind.” The node dropped him like a hot potato. “Though I can’t say I blame you. Enjoy making friends with the ground. Just don’t be a whale. Or a bowl of petunias. The ground takes exception to both, particularly the petunias with it happening twice and all.”


36  A conical hole melting straight through from the brass head down to the chest cavity was still filled with the equivalent of magma, based on the visual effect. No, it was lava. Magma was the underground stuff. So lava was what was currently turning his brand spanking new statue into a colander, by melting it from the inside out, the exterior boiling open and leaking thick ropes of the molten slag. “The distinction is probably unimportant.”
