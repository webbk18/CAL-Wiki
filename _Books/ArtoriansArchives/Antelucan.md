1. A Child sized [Artorian](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Artorian.md) wakes up in [Avalon](../../_Atlas/ArtoriansArchives/Avalon.md), and after getting his feet back under him he flirts with and through a diplay of public affection, embarrasses an equally smol [Ember](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Ember.md).
