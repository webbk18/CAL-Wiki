1. A Child sized [Artorian](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Artorian.md) wakes up in [Avalon](../../_Atlas/ArtoriansArchives/Avalon.md), and after getting his feet back under him he flirts with and through a diplay of public affection, embarrasses an equally smol [Ember](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Ember.md).

4. [Shaka](../../_Characters/ArtoriansArchives/Shaka.md) Shows up as Artorians eats his puzzling noodles, and he shares the nodes of the first tier on the tower.
5. Explanation of Tower Tiers two through ten.
6. Explanation of Tower Tiers eleven through fifteen.
