# Dungeon Eternium
---
**Unlikely allies uniting across the world. Blood feuds that span centuries. A single chance at life.**

The world watches the sky with trepidation. The insanity of [Xenocide](../../_Characters/DivineDungeon/Xenocide.md) knew no bounds, and all will soon suffer the effects he had planned for a millennium. Though none know what is to come, they all know it isn’t going to be easy to survive.

[The Master](../../_Characters/DivineDungeon/TheMaster.md) has a plan, one that can give the world at large a way to escape the onrushing desolation. It may be on the bleeding edge of morality and what he needs might prove too difficult to secure, but The Master asks for trust.

[Cal](../../_Characters/DivineDungeon/Cal.md) and [Dale](../../_Characters/DivineDungeon/Dale.md) both have their role to play as the world hurtles toward destruction. One needs to bring the races of the world together while the other simply needs to survive. Surrounded by supposed allies, the duo will do all that they can to succeed—but with every new arrival comes rising tensions and faltering trust.

The apocalypse is coming. Will honor or greed stand the test of time?
