# AdventurersGuild
---
A group from every non-hostile race that actively seeks treasure and cultivates to become stronger. They act as a mercenary group for Kingdoms that come under attack from monsters and other non-kingdom forces.


If the Adventurers Guild decides to detroy a dungeon on their initial inspection, they will pay the owner of the land 10 gold, and five gold per year for the rest of the land owner's life.

Guild leader in [Mountaindale](../../_Atlas/DivineDungeon/Mountaindale.md) : [Frank](Frank.md)

## Initial Scouting Party
- Elf - B ranked, Leader
- Priest - C Ranked
- Human 2 - C Ranked
- Human 3 - C Ranked

If a non-guild member attacks a Guild member outside of self-defense they cannot join the Guild.

Fighting with another guild member incurs a fee, protecting another earns you a bonus.

Guild rules state that at the start of D-ranks you need to form a team of your own. You can have one person in the C-ranks for guidance but the rest need to also be in the D-ranks or high F-ranks.
