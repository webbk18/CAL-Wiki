Fire

Grew up in the [Lion Kingdom](../../_Lexicon/LionKingdom.md) Capitol. He joined the street gangs as a kid as his mother had died while he was young and he rarely saw his father. After boasting of his Thieving skills, he was extended an offer to be properly trained by one of the hidden guilds. He was taught stealth, legerdemain, pickpocketing as well as Numbers, letters, politics, current events, etiquette. He was told to acquire several memory stones from the Guild hall *(Adventurers?)* containing the cultivation techniques of the nobility. A flesh mage tracked him back to the Thieves Guild and killed everyone there except Hans, as they had found the [Memory Stones](../../_Lexicon/MemoryStone.md).
